### 3D Human Pose Machines with Self-supervised Learning (PAMI 2019)
#### Summary:
Most of the existing methods focus on designing some elaborate priors/constraints to directly regress 3D human poses based on the corresponding 2D human pose-aware features or 2D pose predictions. However, due to the insufficient 3D pose data for training and the domain gap between 2D space and 3D space, these methods have limited scalabilities for all practical scenarios. Attempt to dress this issue, this paper proposes a self-supervised correction mechanism to learn all intrinsic structures of human poses from abundant images. Specifically, the prposed mechanism involves two dual learning tasks which are the 2D-to-3D pose transformation and 3D-to-2D pose projection. Their model first extracts the 2D pose representations and predicts the 2D poses. Considering that the 2D projections of 3D poses and the predicted 2D poses should be identical, the minimization of their dissimilarities is regarded as a learning objective for the 3D-to-2D pose projector module to bidirectionally correct the intermediate 3D pose predictions.
#### Evaluation:
This is a new method to address the lack of 3D pose data. The model uses the 2D pose features to get the 3D pose, then projects the 3D pose to 2D pose, which is supposed to be identical to the 2D pose predictions. By minimizing the dissimilarities between these two 2D pose, the model results is corrected. Based on this thought, the modol does not need the 3D pose data. The model uses several FC layers to project 3D prediction to 2D pose, which may not be to precise as a geometric method which I have not seen in a paper. What if the projection is not right ? Then when the model minimize those 2D pose dissimilarities, it just push the results farther in the wrong way. In conclusion, I do not think this method can be considered a good solution to address the issue, it is commonly acknowledged that the sufficient 3D pose data is extremely necessary for 3D pose estimation. However, owing to the difficulties of labeling the 3D data, we stll have a long way to go to explore some efficient methods based on the relatively precise 2D pose estimation or mutil-view image. It would be great if a semi-superfised or sefi-superfised method is inventioned.
