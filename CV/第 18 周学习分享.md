## Estimation from Monocular Images with Deep Convolutional Neural Network (ACCV 2014)
# Summary:
They are the first to show that deep neural networks can be applied to 3D human pose estimation from single images which is the simplest way that we can come up with to estimate pose. In this paper, they give a framework consisting of two types of tasks to estimate pose, which are a joint point regression task and joint poing detection tasks. The input of both tasks are the bounding box images containing human subjects. Further more, the goal of the regression task is to estimate the positions of joint points relative to the root joint position and the aim of detection task is to classify whether one local window contains the specfic joint. Then, they use the model to test on HUMAN3.6M dataset, which has many pictures of human pose.
# Evaluation:
In this paper, they try to apply DNN to estimating human pose. They also use transfer learning and multi-task learning. This paper is significant because of its pioneering in this specific field.

## 3D Human Pose Estimation = 2D Pose Estimation + Matching (CVPR 2017)
# Summary:
Instead of directly predictiong 3D pose from image, the paper explores a simple two-stage solution that reasons throuth intermediate 2D pose predictions. It basees on a key observation which is deep neural networks have good performance in 2D pose estimation. Given a 3D pose library (essentially a collection of 3D poses), they generate a large number of 2D projections. Given this training set of paired (2D, 3D) data and predictions from a 2D pose estimation algorithm, the depths from the 3D pose associated with the closest matching 2D example from the library are returned. Due to the difficulty of annotation in 3D, training datasets with 3D labels are typically collected in a lab environment, while 2D datasets tend to be more diverse. The two-stage pipeline makes use of different training sets for different stages, resulting in a system that can predict 3D poses from “in-the-wild” images and hence generalize better.
# Evaluation:
Because it is difficult to annotate 3D human pose dataset and there has been a good performance in estimating 2D human pose, this paper proposed that they can match the 2D example to a 3D pose library.
